|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

|     Risk factor: High  CVSSv2: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
|       RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and
|       Cisco CallManager, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a
|       request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as
|       "Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server.
