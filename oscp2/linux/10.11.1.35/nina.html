<center>Hey Nina, here are the stats you requested; just leave your browser opened on this page! The page will refresh automatically every minute so that you won't need to hit F5 (lazy boss ;-)).<br />
I had to whitelist your IP (10.1.1.235) on the firewall (10.11.1.251) in order to let you access this web server!<br /></center>
This is just the quickest solution I could came to, if it's not ok I will create something more stable on the HTTP server inside your subnet.<br />
