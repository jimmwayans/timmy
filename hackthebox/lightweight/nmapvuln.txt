|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL POODLE information leak
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2014-3566  BID:70574
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
|     Disclosure date: 2014-10-14
|     Check results:
|       TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
|       TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV properly implemented
